Hint about randomly choosing image:

When I first created the example, I delegated the responsibility of 
randomly selecting an image to a method like this:



private string spinReel()
{
  Random random = new Random();
  string[] images = new string[] {"Strawberry", "Bar", "Lemon", "Bell", "Clover", "Cherry", "Diamond", "Orange", "Seven", "HorseShoe", "Plum", "Watermelon"};
  return images[random.Next(11)];
}

However, when I ran the application, all three images would ALWAYS be
the same!  The reason?  When you create a new Random class instance:

  Random random = new Random();

The Random class uses an algorithm that APPEARS AS THOUGH it creates a
random number each time, HOWEVER it really uses predictable algorithm
that will return the same results every time.  To make it appear 
truly random, it is "seeded" with the current date and time as ticks.  
However, when we create a new Random class each time and seed it with
the SAME date and time ticks each time (by default) it will always 
return the SAME value!

The fix is easy ... you should only create a new Random class instance
once as a variable OUTSIDE the method, and call random.Next each time 
you need a new number.  

So, mine looks like this:

Random random = new Random();

private string spinReel()
{
  string[] images = new string[] {"Strawberry", "Bar", "Lemon", "Bell", "Clover", "Cherry", "Diamond", "Orange", "Seven", "HorseShoe", "Plum", "Watermelon"};
  return images[random.Next(11)];
}
